# Fuzzy

Fuzzy is a simple fuzzy file finder written in Rust.

## Inspiration

I have been playing with Rust for a while now and was looking for something that would benefit from Rust's speed and concurrency capabilities.
I have been using [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) and that's where I got the idea from.

## Installation

### Mac OS

Install the latest release for max here: https://github.com/sebglazebrook/fuzzy/releases

Then chuck it in your path and remove the osx suffix on the filename.

## Usage

Just type `fuzzy` and press enter.

You'll start to see a list of all files and directories recursivley from your current directory.

Now just start typing to filter the results and find what you need.
