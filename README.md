# Fuzzy

Fuzzy is a simple fuzzy file finder written in Rust.

## Inspiration

I have been playing with Rust for a while now and was looking for something that would benefit from Rust's speed and concurrency capabilities.
I have been using [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) and that's where I got the idea from.
